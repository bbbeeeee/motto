Chrome extension to internalize your goals/mottos.

Rationale
---------------
It's important to truly internalize your values, goals, and mottos. By seeing them whenever you make a new tab, your brain should subliminally register them and over time, internalize them as almost a second nature of a statement. 

I've limited the amount to 3 mottos (once you add more than that, the older ones are erased) because I think you should narrow down what is important to you. You can change it, but I did not leave an option to change it in my version because any more would be too many at once. 3 is a good number. :smiley:
